<h2>About</h2>

<p>PiBBS is a website framework, and Forum/BBS web application. It is light-weighted, easy to deploy and extend.
It displays well on both desktop computers and mobile phones.

<p>Features include:

<ul>
<li>Provide a web framework for sign up, sign in/out, user profile management.
<li>Provide a forum/BBS.
<li>Allow fine control of permissions of board and articles.
<li>Provide an internal mailbox. 
<li>Allow sending external emails and internal emails.
<li>Interface works well on desktop, ipad, and mobile devices.
<li>Allow creation of new themes, mostly by changing files in /theme and /css.
<li>Allow customizable settings, in /conf/conf.php. 
<li>Allow English or Chinese version. Easy to extend to other languages.
</ul> 


<hr>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Development first initiated in Summer 2013 as a forum for <a href="http://homecox.com">homecox.com</a>. 
It stopped for a while, and was picked up again in Summer 2014.


<hr>
<h2>License</h2>

<p>Released under Apache/MIT/BSD/GPLv2 license.


<hr>
<h2>System Requirement</h2>

<p>
Development environment was: 
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.4.34 
<li>Mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.38-35.2, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Earlier versions of PHP and MySQL may work but were not tested.</p>


<hr>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>There is a /INSTALL directory in the package. See /INSTALL/INSTALL.txt for instruction.</p>
<p>Basically, the installation process is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy package to destination folder under web server document root.
<li>Create database:
<ol type="a">
<li>Modify makedb.sql, provide database name, username and password.
<li>Enter Mysql console as admin (mysql -u root -p), run "source makedb.sql" to create an empty database,
<li>In Mysql console, run "source load_data.sql" to create tables and load initial data.
<li>Modify /conf/db_conf.php, to set host, database name, username and password.
</ol>
</li>
<li>For security purpose, you may want to remove the /INSTALL folder, or move it out of document root.
</ol>

<p>
If use <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">phpMyAdmin</a>, then step "2. Create database" above becomes:
</p>

<ol type="a">
<li> Create an empty database from phpMyAdmin GUI.
<li> Run "load_data.sql" in GUI to create tables and load initial data. 
<li> Modify /conf/db_conf.php to set host, database name, username and password.
</ol>

<p>
Note the user documentation (i.e., this documentation) is under /INSTALL/doc. 
</p>

<h2>User Documentation</h2>

<h3>U.1 The homepage</h3>
<p>
The default installation contains five boards: Computer Science, Programming World, 
News, Just for fun, Forum Administration.
</p>

<a href="image/home1_en.png"><img src="image/home1_en.png" class="screenshot" alt="homepage screenshot"></a>

<h3>U.2 Interface of a board</h3>
<p>
This is the "Forum" view of a board. The "Digests" view shows articles labeled as digests, which
will show in the homepage digest list. The "Marks" view shows articles marked as important.
</p>
<a href="image/board1_en.png"><img src="image/board1_en.png" class="screenshot" alt="board screenshot"></a>

<h3>U.3 Post special tags</h3>
<p>
Post allows only plain text initially. Then special tags are added to make posts more informative. These include:

<ul>
<li>To show a hyperlink:
<br/>@[a href="{your link}"] {text} @[/a]
<li>To show an image:
<br/>@[img src="{image link}"]
<br/>You can also specify the display size:
<br/>@[img src="{image link}" width="400" height="200"]
<li>To show a video (Youtube, Youku etc.):
<br/>E.g., the original link is &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src=".." .. allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
<br/>Change to: @[video width="560" height="315" src=".." .. allowfullscreen]
<li>To display an embedded webpage:
<br/>E.g., the webpage address is: url
<br/>Change to: @[iframe width="100%" height="1000" src="url" style="border: 0px;"]
<br/>Note: For videos, use @[iframe] instead of @[video] may cause inconsistent formatting on mobile devices.
<li>To show a segment of code:
<br/>@[code] {your code} @[/code]
<li>To show a segment of code is a textarea with adjustable height:
<br/>@[codearea rows=n] {your code} @[/codearea]
<li>To show bold text:
<br/>@[b] {text} @[/b]
<li>To show underlined text:
<br/>@[u] {text} @[/u]
</ul>
</p>


<p>For example, this post contains a video, two images, an underlined line and a line in bold text.

<h4>S.8.2 Social media sharing icons</h4>

<p>The jiathis.com icon panel can be used. </p>

<p>
To enable this, in /conf/conf.php, set $_BBS_JIA_THIS_POST = 1 or $_BBS_JIA_THIS_THREAD = 1. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The first adds a sharing bar to each post. The code is in /bbs/bbs_func.php function getFooter().
<li>
The second adds a sharing bar to page right border, the code is in /theme/share.php and included in theme/footer.php by default. 
<li>
The second method is preferred since the sharing function shares page url, and there is no need for each post on the
same page to have a separate sharing bar.
</ul>


<hr>
<h2>Developer Documentation</h2>

This is a light-weighted, easy to deploy, use and modify website framework.

This section talks about several important aspects if one wants to develop based on this framework.

<h3>D.1 Database development</h3>

<p>To work on the database, one just needs to include either /func/db.php or /func/db_mysqli.php.

<p>These two files implement exactly the same set if API functions.
/func/db.php uses the mysql connection system calls, which is deprecated by MySQL since 2012. 
/func/db_mysqli.php uses the mysqli connection system calls and is preferred.

<p>The API functions are:

<ul>
<li>db_open()
<br/>Open a database connection.

<li>db_close()
<br/>Close a database connection.

<li>getScalar($query, $col = '')
<br/>Return a single element in the first row of the returned set.
<br/>If $col is empty, use the first element; otherwise use the named element.

<li>executeScalar($query, $col = '')
<br/>Same as getScalar().

<li>executeNonQuery($query)
<br/>Execute a query that does not return any data.

<li>executeRowCount($query)
<br/>Return number of rows in the returned data set.

<li>executeScalarArray($query, $col)
<br/>Return an array of the given field in the query.

<li>executeDataTable($query)
<br/>Return entire table (requested in query) as a DataTable.
<br/>First row is for column names.
<br/>The rest rows are data.

<li>executeAssociateDataTable($query)
<br/>Return entire table (requested in query) as an associate array.
<br/>Compared to executeDataTable, this shifts the processing to calling function.
<br/>Synopsis: <pre>
   $t = executeAssociateDataTable($sql);
   $len = count($t);
   for ($i = 0; $i < $len; ++ $i) {
       $row = $t[$i];
       foreach ($row as $key => $val) {
           print "$key => $val, or value is: $row[$key]";
       }
   }
</pre>

<li>executeAssociateDataTable_2($query)
<br/>Similar to executeAssociateDataTable(), 
but the first row is for header columns, other rows are for data.

<li>executeDataTable_ToHtmlTable($query, $property="", $show_count, $do_htmlencode)
<br/>Given a query, return a html string, showing the return table.
<br/>$query: value is string. the query string.
<br/>$property: value is string. attribute of the table, e.g., class.
<br/>$show_count: value is boolean. whether to show number of row: 1,2, ...
<br/>$do_htmlencode: value is boolean. whether apply db_htmlencode to contents.

</ul>


<p>
Basically, these functions hide database access details.
Returned data are either scalar variable or array, thus easy to munipulate.
</p>

<p>Other related functions:
<ul>
<li>db_htmlEncode($s)
<br/>To display html/xml open/close tags and other special characters from database in browsers correctly.

<li>db_encode($s)
<br/>To encode a query to database, avoid special characters or sql injection.
</ul>

<h3>D.2 Other library functions</h3>

<p>Other library function files also reside in /func/ directory:

<ul>
<li>ClsPage.php, ClsPage.js
<br/>A class for paging of a long list.

<li>Cls_DBTable.php
<br/>A class for manipulating a database table.
<br/>This class will read from database schema and automatically build the view/edit/verify forms.

<li>Cls_DBTable_Custom.php
<br/>A class for manipulating a database table.
<br/>
<br/>This class will read from database schema and automatically build the view/edit/verify forms.
<br/>Customized from Cls_DBTable with this change:
<br/>1) Instead of providing a list of hidden fields, provide a list of given fields and titles.
<br/>2) Added styles for TB, TR, TD.
<br/>3) Added en/cn languages for buttons.
<br/>
<br/>This is convenient when you want to use custom field titles, and in different languages.

<li>avatar.php
<br/>Use avatar from gravatar.com

<li>captcha.php
<br/>Function to create and use a captcha image made of English letters and digits.

<li>captcha_cn.php
<br/>Function to create and use a captcha image made of Chinese characters.

<li>email.php
<br/>Email functions.

<li>mobile.php
<br/>Decide if the browser client is on mobile device.

<li>util.php
<br/>Various utility functions, such as:

<h3>D.3 Authentication</h3>

To use the authentication mechanism of this framework is very easy,
just include certain authentication check files under directory /func.

<ul>
<li>/func/auth.php
<br/>Check if a user has signed in.
<br/>Synopsis: <pre>
&lt;?php
session_start();
require_once("../func/auth.php");
?&gt;
</pre>

<li>/func/auth_board_manager.php
<br/>Check if a signed in user is a board master.
<br/>Synopsis: <pre>
&lt;?php
session_start();
require_once("../func/auth.php");
require_once("../func/auth_board_manager.php");
?&gt;
</pre>

<li>/func/auth_admin.php
<br/>Check if a signed in user is a system administrator.
<br/>Synopsis: <pre>
&lt;?php
session_start();
require_once("../func/auth.php");
require_once("../func/auth_admin.php");
?&gt;
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>D.4 Themes</h3>

<p>
This framework allows a central place to create and use new themes in the /theme and /css directory.
</p>

<p>The /theme folder contains these files:
<ul>
<li>header.php, footer.php
<br/>To be included in any other web interface files, for a consistent look.

<li>themes.php
<br/>This is where a theme is defined and used.
<br/>Based on the theme name, different css files from /css folder is used.
<br/>Here you can define page title, keywords, description, forum's top row banner image and other elements.

<li>share.php
<br/>Include this to display the social media share icons from jiathis.com.
<br/>This file is included in footer.php by default. You can include it in other places too.
</ul>
</p>

<p>The /css folder contains css files for different themes.
<ul>
<li>Right now there are 2 themes: 1) plain and 2) blue. "blue" is the default theme.
</ul>
</p>

<p>To create a new theme, you need to:
<ul>
<li>Change /theme/themes.php, for forum's top row banner image and other elements
<li>In /css, create a new sub-directory, with these css files:
<br/>a) digest.css (for BBS digest), 
<br/>b) menu.css (for menu),  
<br/>c) bbs.css, bbs_mobile.css (for BBS, both desktop and mobile versions), 
<br/>d) site.css, site_mobile.css (for entire site, both desktop and mobile versions).
</ul>
</p>

<h3>D.5 File Upload</h3>

<p>There are currently two places that upload is used: 1) BBS, 2) I-Mail.</p>

<p>
Currently file upload works this way: 
<ul>
<li>A file is first uploaded to a temprary folder,
then copied to final folder when the user submit the BBS post or I-Mail. 
<li>The temp folder is in /upload/[function]/tmp, and final folder is in /upload/[function]/fin.
<li>Under the /tmp or /fin directory, user's username is used as storage folder.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Security:
<ul>
<li>For security purpose, an uploaded file's url cannot be easily guessed. 
<li>For this, a salt,
which is a random string of length ~10 is generated for each BBS post or email, and used
as the part of the the storage folder name.
<li>This way it's very hard to guess the url of the uploaded file.
</ul>
</p>

<p>To create a new upload function, one needs to:
<ul>
<li>Add corresponding storage folders in /upload
<li>Include files file_upload.php, attachment_func.php as in /bbs and /imail, and make corresponding changes.
<li>BBS and I-Mail's upload functions can be used as examples to understand how to implement a new upload function.
</ul>
</p>
